  `My Dearest Hanumanta,\n\nEvery morning I wake up and the first thing I think about is you. Your smile, your laugh, the way you scrunch your nose when you're thinking... everything about you makes my heart skip a beat.\n\nI never knew love could feel this deep, this warm, this... magical. But then you came along and showed me what real love looks like.\n\nForever and always yours,\nYour loving partner 💖`,

  `To My Beautiful Wife,\n\nDo you know what the best part of my day is? It's every single second I spend with you. You make ordinary moments feel extraordinary.\n\nI promise to love you on your best days and especially on your worst days. I promise to always make you laugh and to never let you go to bed upset.\n\nWith all my love,\nYours eternally 💕`,

  `My Love,\n\nIf I had a flower for every time you made me smile, I'd have an endless garden. You bring so much joy into my life that sometimes I have to pinch myself to make sure this is real.\n\nThank you for being you. Thank you for choosing me. Thank you for making every day feel like Valentine's Day.\n\nI love you more than words could ever express,\nForever yours 🌹`,

  `Dearest Hanumanta,\n\nI've been trying to find the right words to tell you how much you mean to me, but honestly? No words are enough. You are my person, my safe place, my greatest adventure.\n\nI love the way you care about everything so deeply. I love your kindness, your strength, your beautiful heart. I love YOU.\n\nTo infinity and beyond,\nYour biggest fan 💖`,

  `My Sweet Love,\n\nRemember when we first met? I knew from that very first moment that you were special. And every day since then, you've proven me right a thousand times over.\n\nYou are the greatest gift life has ever given me. I will spend every day making sure you know just how loved and cherished you are.\n\nWith every beat of my heart,\nYours always and forever 💗`,

  `My Darling Hanumanta,\n\nSometimes I catch myself staring at you and wondering how I got so lucky. You are the most beautiful soul I've ever known, inside and out.\n\nEvery laugh we share, every quiet moment together, every silly argument that ends in giggles — these are the moments I treasure most.\n\nYou are my home,\nForever loving you 💖`,

  `To The Love Of My Life,\n\nIf someone asked me to describe happiness, I'd simply say your name. You've turned my ordinary world into an extraordinary love story.\n\nI don't need grand gestures or fairy tales — all I need is you, right here, right now, forever.\n\nWith all of my heart,\nYour one and only 💕`,
